                        Afghanistan (which literally means Land of the Afghans) is a mountainous land-locked country located in Central Asia. It has a history and culture that goes back over 5000 years. Throughout its long, splendid, and sometimes chaotic history, this area
                        of the world has been known by various names.In ancient times, its inhabitants called the land Aryana. In the medieval era, it was called Khorasan, and in modern times, its people have decided to call it Afghanistan. The exact
                        population of Afghanistan is unknown, however, it is estimated to be somewhere around 31 million. Afghanistan is a heterogeneous nation, in which there are four major ethnic groups: Pashtoons, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. Numerous
                        other minor ethnic groups (Nuristanis, Baluchis, Turkmens, etc.) also call Afghanistan their home. While the majority of Afghans (99%) belong to the Islamic faith, there are also small pockets of Sikhs, Hindus and even some Jews.

                    <p>Prior to their recent destruction, the 6th-7th century, rock-cut Buddha sculptures in the Bamiyan Valley of central Afghanistan were considered the largest in the world. Known collectively as the Bamiyan Buddhas, the two monumental
                        sculptures have amazed both Buddhist and non-Buddhist visitors for more than a thousand years. Like many of the world’s great ancient monuments, little is known about who commissioned the Bamiyan Buddhas or the sculptors who carved
                        them. However, their very existence points to the importance of the Buddhist faith and the Bamiyan Valley during this period. For more head to <a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/west-and-central-asia/a/bamiyan-buddhas>this link</a>.</p>

                    <p>In Afghanistan, the climate is usually arid continental, with cold and relatively rainy winters (and a rainy peak in spring) and hot and sunny summers. However, there are substantial differences depending on area and altitude: the
                        south is desert, many areas are rather cold because of altitude, and the far east is relatively rainy even in summer, since it is partly affected by the Indian monsoon. Precipitation is generally scarce, at semi-desert or desert
                        levels, except in the eastern regions, where it exceeds in some areas 500 millimeters (20 inches) per year, while in the far east, near the border with Pakistan (Kunar and Nurestan provinces), it even reaches 1.000 mm (40 in).For
