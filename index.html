      Afghanistan (which literally means Land of the Afghans) is                       
      a mountainous land-locked country located in Central Asia.                                     
      It has a history and culture that goes back over 5000 years.
      Throughout its long, splendid, and sometimes chaotic history,
      this area of the world has been known by various names.In ancient
      times, its inhabitants called the land Aryana. 
      In the medieval era, it was called Khorasan, and in modern times,
      its people have decided to call it Afghanistan. The exact population
      of Afghanistan is unknown, however, it is estimated to be somewhere 
      around 31 million. Afghanistan is a heterogeneous nation, in which there
      are four major ethnic groups: Pashtoons, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. 
      Numerous other minor ethnic groups (Nuristanis, Baluchis, Turkmens, etc.)
      also call Afghanistan their home. While the majority of Afghans (99%) belong
      to the Islamic faith, there are also small pockets of Sikhs,
      Hindus and even some Jews.

       <p>Prior to their recent destruction, the 6th-7th century, rock-cut Buddha
        sculptures in the Bamiyan Valley of central Afghanistan were considered 
        the largest in the world. Known collectively as the Bamiyan Buddhas, the
        two monumental sculptures have amazed both Buddhist and non-Buddhist visitors
        for more than a thousand years. Like many of the world’s great ancient monuments,
        little is known about who commissioned the Bamiyan Buddhas or the sculptors who 
        carved them. However, their very existence points to the importance of the Buddhist
        faith and the Bamiyan Valley during this period.

      <p>Stretching over 3500 kilometres and across eight countries – Afghanistan
      , Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, Myanmar and Pakistan – the Hindu Kush 
      Himalaya are arguably the world’s most important ‘water tower’, being the source 
      of ten of Asia’s largest rivers as well as the largest volume of ice and snow
      outside of the Arctic and Antarctica. Together these rivers support the drinking water
      , irrigation, energy, industry and sanitation needs of 1.3 billion people living 
      in the mountains and downstream. To explore more visit <a href=https://www.grida.no/resources/12806>this link</a>.</p>
